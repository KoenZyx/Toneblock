# Toneblock
Waveform Synth made with Pure Data and turned into a VST3 using Camomile.  <\br>
 <\br>
TONEBLOCK STILL NEEDS WORK, EXPECT BUGS! <\br>
And please read the following: <\br>
 <\br>
Install notes: <\br>
-Place the Toneblock folder* in your VST3 folder and (if needed) tell your DAW to scan for new plugins.  <\br>
  *the folder name needs to be exactly the same as the name of the vst3 file <\br>
   <\br>
Usage notes: <\br>
-Midi notes are too high, setting the course to -64 is more correct. <\br>
-Waveshaper presets aren't tied into the persistence yet, this may/will affect preset saving/loading. <\br>
-Automating the waveshaper settings is possible but seems to freeze when the UI is visible.  <\br>
-Label messages don't work when the code is loaded as a vst, that's why some of the UI labels seem strange.  <\br>
