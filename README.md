# Toneblock
Waveform Synth made with Pure Data and turned into a VST3 using Camomile. 

TONEBLOCK STILL NEEDS WORK, EXPECT BUGS! 
And please read the following:

## Install notes
- Place the Toneblock folder* in your VST3 folder and (if needed) tell your DAW to scan for new plugins. 
  *the folder name needs to be exactly the same as the name of the vst3 file
  
## Usage notes
- Waveshaper presets aren't tied into the persistence yet, this may/will affect preset saving/loading.
- Automating the waveshaper settings is possible but seems to freeze when the UI is visible.
